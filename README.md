### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nick Tachmazidis, a Data Scientist and PhD candidate and I'm always looking for fun projects to work on.

My PhD research resulted in the creation of [Spectra](https://github.com/NickTachmazidis/Spectra), an open-source application that streamlines the process of pigment analysis for researchers and conservation scientists. You can find it in my repositories.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AWS and enhancing my ML and DL knowledge.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any Data Science/ML/DL problem.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: nick.tachmazidis@gmail.com
