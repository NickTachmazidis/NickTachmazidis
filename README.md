### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nick Tachmazidis, a Data Scientist and PhD candidate. I have over 4+ years of expertise in data processing and data visualization.

I'm always looking for fun projects to work on.

My PhD research resulted in the creation of "Spectra", an open-source application that streamlines the process of pigment analysis for researchers and conservation scientists. You can find it in my repository `Spectra`.
