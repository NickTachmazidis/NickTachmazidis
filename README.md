### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nick Tachmazidis, a Data Scientist and PhD candidate and I'm always looking for fun projects to work on.

My PhD research resulted in the creation of [Spectra](https://github.com/NickTachmazidis/Spectra), an open-source application that streamlines the process of pigment analysis for researchers and conservation scientists. You can find it in my repositories.
